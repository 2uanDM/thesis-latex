Firstly, I would like to express my gratitude to Dr. Dang Tuan Linh for all of his assistance, not just in helping me finish this thesis but also during my four years of university study. I have learned so much from him and those values are extremely valuable to me, which have greatly assisted me in both work and study. Additionally, I also want to sincerely thank Mr. Hung and Ms. Quynh, without whom it's likely I would not have been able to successfully complete this thesis. I am also grateful to other friends, seniors, and contributors, whether in small or large ways, tangible or intangible, for their contributions to this completed thesis today. Finally, I would like to thank my family for always supporting me unconditionally.
