My four years at Hanoi University of Science and Technology are almost complete, a journey filled with both joy and a touch of sadness. More than just knowledge, what I truly treasure are the relationships I've built with friends, teachers, and fellow students.

To Mom and Dad, my deepest and most sincere thanks. You've always supported my choices unconditionally and given me everything to get to where I am today.

I also want to thank my supervisor, Dr. Dang Tuan Linh. Your careful guidance and clear direction were so important in helping me finish my papers, projects, and especially this graduation thesis.

To my friends who stuck by me through tough study sessions – especially my classmates, colleagues, and friends from the Academic Support Club – thank you for your support and companionship. A special shout-out to Huy Tuan, Le Huy, and Viet Anh for helping me with this thesis.

And finally, a heartfelt thank you to my girlfriend, Quynh Nga. Your constant support allowed me to focus and successfully complete many projects, including this thesis.
