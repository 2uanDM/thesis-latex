In this first chapter, I will explain why I decided to write this thesis and what the current solutions for human monitoring are like. Then, I will introduce my feasible solution for monitoring people using computer vision on a hybrid edge-server microservices architecture, which is beneficial for SMEs due to its cost-effectiveness and scalability.

\section{Contributions}

This thesis presents two main contributions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item An application is deployed on hybrid edge-server devices and uses a microservices architecture, allowing for easy system scaling (increasing the number of cameras). It includes:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item A custom-trained, lightweight human detection model specifically designed for CPU-based, resource-constrained edge devices.
        \item A vector database optimization algorithm for efficient identity retrieval. This uses a person's metadata (gender) to reduce the search space, improving retrieval speed and accuracy.
    \end{itemize} 
    \item This thesis also provides an interactive web application. It lets users monitor the system, view live camera streams, and search for people using their metadata.
\end{enumerate}
